## Alert Summary
- Description:
	- Detects when push protection for secret scanning was disabled for your org.
	- org.secret\_scanning\_push\_protection\_disable = Push protection for secret scanning was disabled.
- Reference(s):
    - [Org](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#org)
    - [Protecting Pushes With Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)
- Alert below 
```query
    tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp actor action operation_type org repo
    | eval in(action, 
        "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable"
        )
    | printf -e context "at %v, %v was %v by %v in %v" @timestamp action operation_type actor org repo
    | $GITHUB_ALERT_META("Medium", "Push Protection for Secret Scanning Disabled")
```

***

## Response Steps
### 1. Validate the Alert
- Ensure the event actually occurred.
- Sample Query: Validate the Alert
```query
    tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp actor action operation_type org repo
    | eval in(action, 
        "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable"
        )
    | table @timestamp org repo actor action operation_type
```

### 2. Correlate with Change Management (if available)
- Look up related tickets/change requests.
- Validate whether the activity matches an approved request.

### 3. Investigate the User Account
- Review the user's permissions, role, and previous actions.
- Review other actions by the same user around the event within: 
    - GitHub Audit Logs
    - Firewall Logs
    - Network Logs
    - VPN Logs
    - Proxy Logs
    - IDS/IPS Logs 
    - Host Logs 
    - AV/EDR/XDR Logs 
- Sample Query: View other categorical actions by actor
```query
    tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp org repo actor user invitee actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
    | eval in(action, "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable")
    | grep -e actor "username*"
    | sort by @timestamp desc
    | table @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip user invitee action operation_type user_agent
```

### 4. Investigate the Source IP
- Determine if the IP is internal or external. 
    - You can add this to quickly determine whether it is PRIVATE or PUBLIC 
    - [IP Module Documentation] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/ip/ip.html)
    - Sample Query: View other categorical actions by Source IP (replace #.#.#.# with IP)
```query
        tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
        | eval in(action, "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable")
        | sort by @timestamp desc
        | ip -categorize actor_ip
        | grep -e actor_ip "#.#.#.#" 
        | table @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
```
- Determine more contextual information about the IP address
    - It is highly recommended to have an IP lookup (uploaded resource) of your environment(s) IP Ranges to filter off of. 
    - [IPLookup Module Documentation] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/iplookup/iplookup.html) 
    - Sample Query: Lookup IP Range against internal ranges
```query
        tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type
        | eval in(action, "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable")
        | sort by @timestamp desc
        | grep -e actor_ip "#.#.#.#"
        | iplookup -r REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_RESOURCE -e actor_ip field_to_extract as new_EV_name
        | table @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type
```
- Determine if the IP Address is outside of the Country
    - [GeoIP Module Documentation] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/geoip/geoip.html)
    - Sample Query: Show City, Country, & CountryName with GeoIP 
```query
        tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type
        | eval in(action, "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable")
        | sort by @timestamp desc
        | grep -e actor_ip "#.#.#.#"
        | geoip actor_ip.Location actor_ip.City actor_ip.Country actor_ip.CountryName
        | table @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type
```

### 5. Look for Related Logins
- Identify logins or auth events by the actor (or from the IP) prior to modification.
- Sample Query: View logins, failed logins, and related activity (replace username & IP)
```query
    tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
    | eval (actor=="username" || actor_ip=="#.#.#.#" || in(action, "org.secret_scanning_push_protection_disable"))
    | sort by @timestamp desc
    | ip -categorize actor_ip
    | table @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
```

### 6. Broader Contextual Review
- Check if multiple actions were performed in a short time window. 
- Look for anomalies like unusual repositories, organizations, or unexpected actors.
- Sample Query: View all actions by actor
```query
    tag=$GITHUB_AUDIT json @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
    | grep -e actor "username*"
    | sort by @timestamp desc
    | table @timestamp org repo actor actor_ip action operation_type user_agent
```

### 7. Escalation Criteria
- Escalate if:
    - Activity was not authorized or approved.
    - Action was from an unusual IP (geolocation mismatch, external network) for the user's typical network interaction.
    - Unauthorized or unusual activity is detected.

### 8. Document & Close
- Record findings in ticketing/IR platform.
- If benign/authorized, close with justification.
    - Submit tune requests; such as, updating the allow/block list to yield better alert results. 
- If suspicious, escalate for containment & response.
