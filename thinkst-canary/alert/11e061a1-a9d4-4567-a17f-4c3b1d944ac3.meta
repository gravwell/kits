 "Description": "Detects when a flock has had more than 1 action occur. \n\nflock_create = A Flock allows you to group Sensors and users. It allows you to configure settings that are specific only to the Flock, including notification channels and recipients.\n\nFlocks are defined by a unique flock_id which is returned in the response when calling this endpoint.\n\nflock_delete = Deleting a Flock will remove it from your Console. You can only delete an empty Flock, meaning you'll need to move (or remove) any Sensors from the Flock before deleting it.\n\nWARNING: You cannot delete the Default Flock, but you can Rename it if you want to.\n\nflock_move = Move a specified Sensor to a Flock. You'll need to delete all incidents before moving a Sensor between Flocks (this ensures that sensitive data isn't spilled across Flocks). If there are still incidents tied to the Sensor, you can specify clear_incidents=true to clear all of those incidents.\n\nflock_rename = Rename an existing Flock\n\nReference(s):\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html\n\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html#create-flock\n\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html#delete-flock\n\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html#move-sensor-to-flock\n\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html#rename-flock",
