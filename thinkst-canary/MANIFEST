This is a detailed explanation of all configuration options.\n- [thinkst.go] (https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell/blob/main/experiments/gravwell_fetcher/thinkst.go): This file implements the Config definitions and parsing from thinkstConfig.go when you build Fetcher.\n- [thinkstConfig.go] (https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell/blob/main/experiments/gravwell_fetcher/thinkstConfig.go): This file defines the configuration data structures and parsing for the Thinkst Canary integrations in Fetcher.\n\n***\n\n## 2) Download, Install and Configure the Gravwell Fetcher\n\n**Summary:** The Gravwell Fetcher provides a lightweight Go-based fetcher that polls external APIs (including Thinkst Canary endpoints) and ingests events into Gravwell. \nThe Fetcher includes an [example configuration file] (https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell/blob/main/experiments/gravwell_fetcher/gravwell_fetcher.conf.example) which you need to copy and adapt for your environment prior to running the fetcher. See the [README] (https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell/blob/main/experiments/gravwell_fetcher/README.md) for further information. \n\n### Basic installation steps (example)\n\n1. Clone the Gravwell repo (or just the experiment):  \n    _git clone https://github.com/gravwell/gravwell.git_\n\n2. Change directory to the fetcher experiment:  \n_cd gravwell/experiments/gravwell\\_fetcher_\n\n3. Build the fetcher binary (standard Go build):  \n_go build -o gravwell\\_fetcher_\n\n4. Copy the example config to a location you will edit  \n    e.g. /etc/gravwell/gravwell\\_fetcher.conf or /opt/gravwell/etc/gravwell\\_fetcher.conf:  \n_cp gravwell\\_fetcher.conf.example /etc/gravwell/gravwell\\_fetcher.conf_\n\n5. Edit _/etc/gravwell/gravwell\\_fetcher.conf_ and replace the Thinkst Canary Domain and Token values (see example below).  \n\n6. Run the fetcher (from the built binary).  \n    Typical invocation (binary + config file):  \n    _./gravwell\\_fetcher -config /etc/gravwell/gravwell\\_fetcher.conf_\n\n**Important:** the canonical example config shipped with the experiment is gravwell_fetcher.conf.example — copy it and update the values.\n\n2.1 Example Gravwell Fetcher Conf (repo)\n- The repository contains _experiments/gravwell\\_fetcher/gravwell\\_fetcher.conf.example_ which is the canonical example used by this kit. Use that file as the starting point and replace the Thinkst Canary Domain, Token, and any Ingester/connection settings as appropriate.  \n\n2.2 Gravwell Fetcher Example Config for Thinkst Canary  \n\t\n```ini\n    [Global]  \n\tIngester-UUID=\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000\"  \n\tConnection-Timeout = 0  \n\tInsecure-Skip-TLS-Verify=false  \n\t#Cleartext-Backend-Target=127.0.0.1:4023  \n\t#Encrypted-Backend-Target=127.1.1.1:4024  \n\t#Pipe-Backend-Target=/opt/gravwell/comms/pipe  \n\t#Ingest-Cache-Path=/opt/gravwell/cache/thinkst.cache  \n\t#Max-Ingest-Cache=1024  \n\tLog-Level=INFO  \n\tLog-File=/opt/gravwell/log/thinkst_fetcher.log  \n\n\t[ThinkstConf \"thinkst-audit\"]\n\tThinkstAPI=\"audit\"\n\tToken=\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN\"\n\tDomain=\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CANARY_DOMAIN.canary.tools\"\n\tStartTime=\"2025-01-01T00:00:01.000Z\"\n\tTag-Name=\"thinkst-audit\"\n\n\t[ThinkstConf \"thinkst-incident\"]\n\tThinkstAPI=\"incident\"\n\tToken=\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN\"\n\tDomain=\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CANARY_DOMAIN.canary.tools\"\n\tStartTime=\"2025-01-01T00:00:01.000Z\"\n\tTag-Name=\"thinkst-incident\"\n```\n\t\n***\n\n3) Tags \u0026 Macros\n- thinkst-audit: used to tag Canary audit trail events.\n\t- Usage: tag=thinkst-audit\n\t- thinkst-incident: used to tag Canary incident events.\n\t- Usage: tag=thinkst-incident\n- $CANARY\\_AUDIT: Configuration Macro; Tag used for Thinkst Canary Audit data; necessary for any queries utilizing this macro within the Gravwell Thinkst Canary Kit to run properly.\n\t- Usage: tag=$CANARY\\_AUDIT\n\t- $CANARY\\_INCIDENT: Configuration Macro; Tag used for Thinkst Canary Incident data; necessary for any queries utilizing this macro within the Gravwell Thinkst Canary Kit to run properly.\n\t- Usage: tag=$CANARY\\_INCIDENT\n- $CANARY\\_INCIDENT\\_ALERT: This was built to dynamically create Thinkst Canary Incident Alerts based on all of the Incident Objects.\n\t- The alert titled \"Alert -

[Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html)\n        - [Dispatchers](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html#adding-dispatchers) = [Scheduled Searches](#8-scheduled-searches)\n            - Dispatchers generate events. A typical dispatcher would be a scheduled search that runs every hour looking for “bad” activity; every result returned by a scheduled search is considered an event.\n        - [Consumers](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html#defining-a-consumer) = [Flows](#8-1-flows)\n            - Consumers process and respond to events. A typical consumer would be a flow that sends an email to an administrator, or opens a ticket in the ticketing system. Each consumer runs once per event.\n\t- Total: 59\n\t- Naming Schema: _Alert - Canary - Category - Severity/Priority - AlertName_\n\n***\n\n8) Scheduled Searches\n- Purpose: Scheduled Searches are dependent on the [alert query](#10-1-alert-query) queries titled _\"AlertQuery - Canary - Category - Severity/Priority - AlertName\"_ within the [Query Library](#4-query-library).\n\t- **IMPORTANT:** If an [Alert Query](#10-1-alert-query) is modified within the query library, it will be modified in the associated Scheduled Search. \n\t- **DISCLAIMER:** There are a few queries which take advantage of the [GeoIP] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/geoip/geoip.html) module that requires the Gravwell Network Enrichment Kit (currently version 19) or your own curated GeoIP database.\n\t\t- The Network Enrichment Kit can be found in the [Kits] (https://docs.gravwell.io/kits/kits.html) section of your Gravwell instance.\n\t\t- **Note:** Any query containing \"from Outside Country\" is implicated in this so if those scheduled searches are failing; I'd suggest troubleshooting here.\n\t- Total: 59\n\t- Naming Schema: _ScheduledSearch - Canary - Category - Severity/Priority - ScheduledSearchName_\n\t- Cron schedules:\n\t- High: 6 \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\t- Medium: 37 \\*/2 \\* \\* \\*\n\t- Low: 49 \\*/4 \\* \\* \\*\n\t- **Exception:** _ScheduledSearch - Thinkst - Canary - Incident_ runs every 30 minutes.\n\n\n***\n\n9) Playbooks\n- Purpose: Playbooks are intended to be utilized as investigation aids for [Alerts](#7-alerts).
