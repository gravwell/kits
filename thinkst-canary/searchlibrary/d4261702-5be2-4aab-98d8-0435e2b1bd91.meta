 "Description": "Detects when a flock has been moved.\n\nflock_move = Move a specified Sensor to a Flock. You'll need to delete all incidents before moving a Sensor between Flocks (this ensures that sensitive data isn't spilled across Flocks). If there are still incidents tied to the Sensor, you can specify clear_incidents=true to clear all of those incidents.\n\nReference(s):\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html\n\nhttps://docs.canary.tools/flocks/actions.html#move-sensor-to-flock",
