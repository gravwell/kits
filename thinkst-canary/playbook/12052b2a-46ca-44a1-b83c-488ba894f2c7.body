## Alert Summary
- Description:
	- Detects when a user attempts to login in from outside Country.
	- Default = US / United States (If not within United States, change necessary)
	- user\_login\_failed = Displays when a user failed to login.
	- *Network Enrichment Kit is required*
- Reference(s):
    - [Audit Trail](https://docs.canary.tools/console/audit-trail.html#audit-trail)
    - [Fetch Audit Trail Logs](https://docs.canary.tools/console/audit-trail.html#fetch-audit-trail-logs)

## Response Steps
### 1. Validate the Alert
- Ensure the event actually occurred.
- Sample Query: Validate the Alert
```query
    tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json timestamp action_type user user_ip message flock_id flock_name
    | eval in(action_type, 
        "user_login_failed"
        )
    | stats unique_count by user user_ip over 5m
    | regex -e message "(?<operation>Login\s\w+)"
    | lower operation
    | regex -e message "using\s(?<method>.*?)?\."
    | ip user_ip
    | geoip user_ip.Location user_ip.City user_ip.Country user_ip.CountryName
    | eval (Country!="US"||CountryName!="United States")
    | table flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message unique_count method operation timestamp
```

### 2. Correlate with Change Management (if available)
- Look up related tickets/change requests.
- Validate whether the activity matches an approved request.

### 3. Investigate the User Account
- Review the user's permissions, role, and previous actions.
- Review other actions by the same user around the event within: 
    - Thinkst Canary Logs 
    - Firewall Logs
    - Network Logs
    - VPN Logs
    - Proxy Logs
    - IDS/IPS Logs 
    - Host Logs 
    - AV/EDR/XDR Logs 
- Sample Query: View other categorical actions by user
```query
    tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json action_type flock_id flock_name message TIMESTAMP user user_ip
    | eval in(action_type, "user_login_failed")
    | grep -e user "username*"
    | sort by TIMESTAMP desc
    | table TIMESTAMP flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message
```

### 4. Investigate the Source IP
- Determine if the IP is internal or external. 
    - You can add this to quickly determine whether it is PRIVATE or PUBLIC 
    - [IP Module Documentation] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/ip/ip.html)
    - Sample Query: View other categorical actions by Source IP (replace #.#.#.# with IP)
```query
        tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json action_type flock_id flock_name message TIMESTAMP user user_ip
        | eval in(action_type, "user_login_failed")
        | sort by TIMESTAMP desc
        | ip -categorize user_ip
        | grep -e user_ip "#.#.#.#"
        | table TIMESTAMP flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message
```
- Determine more contextual information about the IP address
    - It is highly recommended to have an IP lookup (uploaded resource) of your environment(s) IP Ranges to filter off of. 
    - [IPLookup Module Documentation] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/iplookup/iplookup.html) 
    - Sample Query: Lookup IP Range against internal ranges
```query
        tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json action_type flock_id flock_name message TIMESTAMP user user_ip
        | eval in(action_type, "user_login_failed")
        | sort by TIMESTAMP desc
        | grep -e user_ip "#.#.#.#"
        | iplookup -r REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_RESOURCE -e user_ip field_to_extract as new_EV_name
        | table TIMESTAMP flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message
```
- Determine if the IP Address is outside of the Country
    - [GeoIP Module Documentation] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/geoip/geoip.html)
    - Sample Query: Show City, Country, & CountryName with GeoIP 
```query
        tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json action_type flock_id flock_name message TIMESTAMP user user_ip
        | eval in(action_type, "user_login_failed")
        | sort by TIMESTAMP desc
        | grep -e user_ip "#.#.#.#"
        | geoip user_ip.Location user_ip.City user_ip.Country user_ip.CountryName
        | table TIMESTAMP flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message
```

### 5. Look for Related Logins
- Identify logins by the user (or potential users who logged in during that timeframe) or activity from the IP address prior to modification.
- Sample Query: View logins, failed logins, and related activity (replace username & IP)
```query
    tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json action_type flock_id flock_name message TIMESTAMP user user_ip
    | eval (user=="username" || user_ip=="#.#.#.#" || action_type=="user_login" || action_type=="user_login_failed" || action_type=="user_login_failed")
    | ip -categorize user_ip
    | table TIMESTAMP flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message
```

### 6. Broader Contextual Review
- Check if multiple actions were performed in a short time window. 
- Look for anomalies like unusual flock names or unexpected users.
- Sample Query: View all actions by user
```query
    tag=$CANARY_AUDIT json action_type flock_id flock_name message TIMESTAMP user user_ip
    | grep -e user "username*"
    | sort by TIMESTAMP desc
    | table TIMESTAMP flock_id flock_name action_type user user_ip message
```

### 7. Escalation Criteria
- Escalate if:
    - Activity was not authorized or approved.
    - Action was from an unusual IP (geolocation mismatch, external network) for the user's typical network interaction.
    - Unauthorized or unusual activity is detected.

### 8. Document & Close
- Record findings in ticketing/IR platform.
- If benign/authorized, close with justification.
    - Submit tune requests; such as, updating the allow/block list to yield better alert results. 
- If suspicious, escalate for containment & response.
