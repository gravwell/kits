Every entry has a single tag associated with it; these tags allow us to separate and categorize data at a basic level.\n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/ingesters/ingesters.html#tags)\n- The Okta Kit for Gravwell makes use of the following tags:\n    - okta-groups: Tag contains all of your Okta Group Log data.\n        - Usage: tag=okta-groups\n    - okta-users: Tag contains all of your Okta Users Log data.\n        - Usage: tag=okta-users\n    - okta-system: Tag contains all of your Okta System Log data.\n        - Usage: tag=okta-system\n\n#### 1.2. [Macros](#1-2-macros)\n- Purpose: Search macros are a powerful feature that can help you use Gravwell more effectively. Macros can turn long, repetitive search queries into easily-remembered shortcuts.\n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/search/macros.html)\n- The Okta Kit for Gravwell makes use of the following macros:\n    - Tags\n        - $OKTA: Configuration Macro; Tag used for querying all of your Okta data; necessary for any queries within the Gravwell Okta Kit to run properly.\n        - $OKTA\\_GROUPS: Configuration Macro; Tag used for Okta Groups data; necessary for any queries within the Gravwell Okta Kit to run properly for dashboards, query library, and templates.\n        - $OKTA\\_USERS: Configuration Macro; Tag used for Okta Users data; necessary for any queries within the Gravwell Okta Kit to run properly for dashboards, query library, and templates.\n        - $OKTA\\_SYSTEM: Configuration Macro; Tag used for Okta System Log data; necessary for any queries within the Gravwell Okta Kit to run properly for dashboard, query library, scheduled searches, alerts, flows, and templates.\n    - EVX (Enumerated Value Extraction)\n        - $OKTA\\_USER\\_EVX: This macro extracts all possible Enumerated Values (EVs) from Okta User Logs.\n        - $OKTA\\_SYSTEM\\_EVX: This macro extracts all possible Enumerated Values (EVs) from Okta System Logs.\n    - Alert Components\n        - Alert Base\n            - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_BASE: This is the base of which all alerts are built upon. This is necessary for the rest of the actual alerting logic to occur due to the Enumerated Value Extraction (EVX), EV enrichment and normalization performed by the dependencies listed below.\n            - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_EVX: This macro extracts all of the necessary Enumerated Values (EVs) for the $OKTA\\_CATALOG\\_ALERTS and $OKTA\\_MOD\\_ALERTS macros from the Okta System Logs.\n            - $OKTA\\_ENRICH\\_COMMON: This is a dependency as a part of the $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_BASE which all alerts are built upon. This is necessary for the rest of the actual alerting logic to occur due to the Enumerated Value enrichment and normalization performed by the macro.\n        - Risk\n            - $OKTA\\_MOD\\_RISK\\_SCORE: This rule dynamically calculates an Okta risk score based on event type, category, subcategory, modifications, severity, outcome, and proxy usage for modification event types. This is a dependency as a part of the $OKTA\\_MOD\\_ALERTS which all modification event type alerts are built upon. It calculates a risk score based on the event type, category, and subcategory with bumps for severity, outcome, proxy usage, modification event types, privileged & protected users then dumps it into a priority bucket. \n            - $OKTA\\_CATALOG\\_RISK\\_SCORE: This is a dependency as a part of the $OKTA\\_CATALOG\\_ALERTS which all catalog alerts are built upon. It calculates a risk score based on the event type, category, and subcategory with bumps for severity, outcome, proxy usage, modification event types, privileged & protected users then dumps it into a priority bucket. \n        - Tuning\n            - $OKTA\\_IP\\_TUNING: Provides tuning for source IPs using okta\\_ip\\_allowlist.csv and okta\\_ip\\_denylist.csv.\n            - $OKTA\\_USER\\_TUNING: Provides tuning for users (actor/target) using okta\\_user\\_allowlist.csv and okta\\_user\\_denylist.csv, keyed on normalized usernames emitted by $OKTA\\_ENRICH\\_COMMON (actorUserNorm/targetUserNorm).\n        - Gating\n            - $OKTA\\_CATALOG\\_GATE: Catalog-driven gating dependency for Elastic and Sigma rulesets within $OKTA\\_CATALOG\\_ALERTS. \n        - Reporting & Searching\n            - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_META: This macro standardizes output for Okta Alerts that are being alerted upon. It dynamically changes values in the \\_alert\\_title based on the core of the query. e.g. tag=$OKTA\\_SYSTEM $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_EVX $OKTA\\_RISK\\_SCORE $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_META\n            - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_SEARCH: This macro enables you to search an alert by any of the Enumerated Values (EVs) created during the entire alert building query. The key fields to query to find more information typically are \\_alert\\_title, and context.\n            - $OKTA\\_NORMALIZE\\_IP: This macro normalizes clientIp and requestIp into a new EV named src that is used to search both fields for a specific IP address. It must be run after $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_BASE.\n            - $OKTA\\_NORMALIZE\\_ACTOR: This macro normalizes actorAltId and actorName into a new EV named actor that is used to search both fields for a specific actor. It must be run after $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_BASE.\n            - $OKTA\\_NORMALIZE\\_TARGET: This macro normalizes targetAltId and targetName into a new EV named target that is used to search both fields for a specific target. It must be run after $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_BASE.\n            - $OKTA\\_NORMALIZE\\_USER: This macro creates a new combined EV of actor and target meaning that you can search for a specific user as actor or target within the user EV without having to create an or statement for those EVs. This also means that you can independently query actor, target, and user which is useful in tracking a threat actor from the initial alert to other linked events. This macro must be used after both $OKTA\\_NORMALIZE\\_ACTOR, and $OKTA\\_NORMALIZE\\_TARGET.\n    - [Alert Queries](#8-1-alert-queries)  & [Scheduled Searches](#6-scheduled-searches) \n        - $OKTA\\_CATALOG\\_ALERTS: Detects Elastic & Sigma alerts that are configured within the okta\\_alerts\\_catalog lookup resource. \n        - $OKTA\\_MOD\\_ALERTS: Detects modification alerts that are configured within the okta\\_alerts\\_catalog lookup resource.\n    - [Flows](#6-1-flows)\n        - $GRAVWELL\\_INSTANCE: Configuration Macro; Necessary for alerts within the Okta Kit to link data to the notification email\n        - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_RECIPIENT: Configuration Macro: This is the address to which Okta Alert Flows will be sent to. Email Server Settings must be configured under Account > Email Server > Email Server Settings in order for your alerts to function properly.\n        - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_SENDER: Configuration Macro: This is the address to which Okta Alert Flows will be sent from. Email Server Settings must be configured under Account > Email Server > Email Server Settings in order for your alerts to function properly.\n    - [Dashboard](#10-dashboards) Components\n        - $OKTA\\_INVESTIGATION\\_SEARCH: This is intended to be used in the Okta Investigation Templates so the queries are clean and modular.\n        - Authentication\n            - $OKTA\\_FAILED\\_AUTH: This macro is used by \"Template - Okta - Investigation - Failed Authentication Attempts for Actor, Target, and/or IP\" in the Okta Investigation Dashboard and can be reused when looking at failed authentication events as long as outcomeResult, and message are extracted.\n            - $OKTA\\_SUCCESSFUL\\_AUTH: This macro is used by \"Template - Okta - Investigation - Successful Authentication Events for Actor, Target, and/or IP\" in the Okta Investigation Dashboard and can be reused when looking at successful authentication events as long as outcomeResult, and message are extracted.\n            - $OKTA\\_COMBINED\\_AUTH: This macro is used by \"Template - Okta - Investigation - Authentication Events for Actor, Target, and/or IP by Country [table]\" in the Okta Investigation Dashboard and can be reused when looking at authentication events as long as outcomeResult, and message are extracted.\n        - Reporting\n            - $OKTA\\_ALERT\\_INFO: This macro standardizes output for Okta Alerts that are being alerted upon. It dynamically changes values in the \\_alert\\_title based on the core of the query. This is used for the Okta Investigation Dashboard to simply show the Alert Title and Alert Priority without the context as that will be displayed in the Modification Alert Events and the Catalog Alert Events.\n\n***\n\n## 2. [Query Library](#2-query-library)  \n- Purpose: Queries within the Query Library drive [dashboards](#10-dashboards) via [searches](#10-searches), [scheduled searches](#8-scheduled-searches) via [alert queries](#10-1-alert-query), and [playbooks](#9-playbooks). \n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/gui/querylibrary/querylibrary.html)\n\t- Updating a query in the library updates dependent dashboards scheduled searches automatically.\n\t- Total queries: 43  \n\t    - [Alert Queries](#8-1-alert-query): 2  \n\t    - [Searches](#8-searches): 41   \n\n***\n\n## 3. [Naming Schema](#3-naming-schema)  \n- Purpose: The use of a standard naming convention enables users to quickly understand the function, severity, and context of a query or component. This approach facilitates efficient identification, reuse, and troubleshooting without ambiguity.  \n- _QueryType - Company - Category - Severity/Priority - \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Name [Visualization - **if any**]_\n- Examples:\n    - [Alerts](#5-alerts): _Alert - Okta - System - Alert Catalog - Elastic & Sigma Rulesets_\n    - [Scheduled Searches](#6-scheduled-searches): _ScheduledSearch - Okta - System - Alert Catalog - Elastic & Sigma Rulesets_\n    - [Playbook](#7-playbooks): _Playbook - Okta - System - Event Types - Modification Alerts_\n    - [Searches](#8-searches): _Search - Okta - Authentication - Activated to Last Updated Average [numbercard]_\n    - [Alert Query](#8-1-alert-query): _AlertQuery - Okta - System - Alert Catalog - Elastic & Sigma Rulesets_\n    - [Templates](#9-templates): _Template - Okta - Investigation - Failed Authentication Attempts for Actor, Target, and/or IP_\n\n***\n\n## 4.

[Alerts](#5-alerts)  \n- Purpose: Alerts notify you of potential nefarious actions that took place within and/or against your environment by tying dispatchers and consumers together.  \n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html#alerts)\n\t- Alerts are made up of Dispatchers and Consumers that ensure that when a dispatcher generates an event, all associated consumers are executed to process it. \n    - [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html)\n- Total: 2\n    - Alert - Okta - System - Alert Catalog - Elastic & Sigma Rulesets\n    - Alert - Okta - System - Event Types - Modification Alerts\n- Naming Schema: _Alert - Okta - Category - Severity/Priority - AlertName_\n#### 5.1 [Dispatchers](#5-1-dispatchers)  \n- Purpose: Dispatchers generate events. A typical dispatcher would be a scheduled search that runs every hour looking for “bad” activity; every result returned by a scheduled search is considered an event.  \n    - Dispatchers = [Scheduled Searches](#6-scheduled-searches)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html#adding-dispatchers)\n#### 5.2 [Consumers](#5-2-consumers)\n- Purpose: Consumers process and respond to events. A typical consumer would be a flow that sends an email to an administrator, or opens a ticket in the ticketing system. Each consumer runs once per event.\n    - Consumers = [Flows](#6-1-flows)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/alerts/alerts.html#defining-a-consumer)  \n\n***\n\n## 6. [Scheduled Searches](#6-scheduled-searches)  \n- Purpose: Scheduled Searches are dependent on the [alert query](#10-1-alert-query) queries titled _\"AlertQuery - Okta - Category - Severity/Priority - AlertName\"_ within the [Query Library](#4-query-library).\n- [Documentation](https://docs.gravwell.io/scripting/scheduledsearch.html)\n\t- **IMPORTANT:** If an [Alert Query](#8-1-alert-query) is modified within the query library, it will be modified in the associated Scheduled Search. \n\t- **DISCLAIMER:** There are a few queries which take advantage of the [GeoIP] (https://docs.gravwell.io/search/geoip/geoip.html) module that requires the Gravwell Network Enrichment Kit (currently version 19) or your own curated GeoIP database.\n\t\t- The Network Enrichment Kit can be found in the [Kits] (https://docs.gravwell.io/kits/kits.html) section of your Gravwell instance.\n\t\t- **Note:** Any query containing \\\"from Outside Country\\\" is implicated in this so if those scheduled searches are failing; I'd suggest troubleshooting here.\n- Total: 2\n    - ScheduledSearch - Okta - System - Alert Catalog - Elastic & Sigma Rulesets\n    - ScheduledSearch - Okta - System - Event Types - Modification Alerts\n- Naming Schema: _ScheduledSearch - Okta - Category - Severity/Priority - ScheduledSearchName_\n\t- Cron schedules:\n\t- _ScheduledSearch - Okta - System - Alert Catalog - Elastic & Sigma Rulesets_: 15 \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\t- _ScheduledSearch - Okta - System - Event Types - Modification Alerts_: 30 \\* \\* \\* \\*\n#### 6.1.
